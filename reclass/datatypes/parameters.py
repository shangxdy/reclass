class Parameters(object):
    '''
    A class to hold nested dictionaries with the following specialities:

      1. "merging" a dictionary (the "new" dictionary) into the current
         Parameters causes a recursive walk of the new dict, during which

         - scalars (incl. tuples) are replaced with the value from the new
           dictionary;
         - lists are extended, not replaced;
         - dictionaries are updated (using dict.update), not replaced;

      2. "interpolating" a dictionary means that values within the dictionary
         can reference other values in the same dictionary. Those references
         are collected during merging and then resolved during interpolation,
         which avoids having to walk the dictionary twice. If a referenced
         value contains references itself, those are resolved first, in
         topological order. Therefore, deep references work. Cyclical
         references cause an error.

    To support these specialities, this class only exposes very limited
    functionality and does not try to be a really mapping object.
